AND CONDITIONS OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE

AND CONDITIONS OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE
AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE, PROMPTLY

In return for our granting to you a license to use the Software

1. Grant of License:

1.1 Standard Rights and Restrictions. The Software is the
intellectual property of Fonthead Design ("Fonthead") and
its licensors, and is protected by law, including United States
copyright laws and international treaties.


Fonthead grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to: (a) install the Software at a single location on a
hard disk or other storage device for use on the number of workstations
indicated at the beginning of this License Agreement ("Permitted Number of
Workstations"); or Provided the Software is configured for network use,
install and use the Software on a single file server for use on a single
local area network for either (but not both) of the following purposes;
(1) permanent installation onto a hard disk or other storage device for
use on the Permitted Number of Workstations; or (2) use of the Software
over such network, provided the number of different workstations on which
the Software is used does not exceed being used on the Permitted Number
of Workstations. 

Make one backup copy of the Software. 

You may use the font Software as described
above on the Permitted Number of Workstations and may output such font
Software on any output device connected to such workstations. In
addition, if the Number of Permitted Workstations is five or less, you may
download the font Software to the memory (hard disk or RAM) of one output
device connected to at least one of such workstations for the purpose of
having such font product remain resident in the output device, and of one
additional such output device for every multiple Number of Permitted
Workstations. 

You may give a copy of this Software to any service bureau which you hire
to output your film, paper or colour proofs, provided that they do not use
the font Software for any purpose other than outputing your work. They may
keep the font Software on file for use with future jobs on your behalf.

If there are illustrations or images in the font Software other than letterforms,
numbers, punctuation marks, diacritics, etc, you may NOT use the font
Software in a manner where the illustration or image becomes the
primary aspect of a product for resale. For example, if an image was used on a
coffee cup, to sell the coffee cup, or on a t-shirt to sell the t-shirt or on a
greeting card to sell the greeting card, etc. 

If the font Software is needed to be used on more than the Permitted
Number of Workstations, or for other purposes, additional licensing may be
required and you must contact Fonthead Design for more information. 


2. Proprietary Rights. This Software is licensed, not sold, to
you by Fonthead, for use only under the terms of this Agreement.
As a licensee, you own the magnetic and/or optical media on
which the Software is recorded, but Fonthead retains title to and
ownership of the Software itself, and all copies of the Software,
including the copy(ies) contained in this package.


3. No Other Rights. Except as stated above, this Agreement
does not grant you any other right to patents, copyrights, trade
secrets, trade names, trademarks (whether registered or
unregistered), or any other rights, franchises, or licenses with
respect to the Software and documentation.

COPY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART without express permission
from Fonthead Design.


5. Term. This license is effective until terminated. You may
terminate this license at any time by destroying the Software
and its documentation together with all copies or modifications
in any form. Fonthead will have the right to terminate your
license immediately if you fail to comply with any term or
condition of this Agreement. You agree that, upon any such
termination, you will destroy the Software and its
documentation together with all copies or modifications in any
form.
