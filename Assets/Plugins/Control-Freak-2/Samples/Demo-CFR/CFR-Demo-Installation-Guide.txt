Control Freak Racing is using assets from Unity 3.x Car Demo, but
they are too big to be included in the Control Freak 2 package.

To install the demo :

1. Download and import 'Part 1' package from : http://dansgametools.blogspot.com/p/cfr-assets-download.html

2. Import 'Part 2' package from /Assets/Plugins/Control-Freak-2/Samples/Demo-CFR/.

3. Combined assets are now located in /Assets/Control-Freak-2-Samples-Extra/.
